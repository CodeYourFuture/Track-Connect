# Contribution Guide

## Welcome to the CYF Curriculum

We are a volunteer-led community of tech professionals, and we teach people to code for free. We are majority-minority, we welcome everyone, and we welcome _you_.

## Who runs this?

The Global Syllabus Team is a group of long term CYF volunteers who are responsible for the overall direction of the curriculum. All Tech Ed volunteers can, and do, develop content for the curriculum, but the Global Syllabus Team decide the strategy and accept new content into the core.

This team is led by the director, currently [Sally McGrath](https://github.com/SallyMcGrath). We meet every two weeks to discuss the curriculum and make decisions. The agenda is posted in the CYF Slack channel #cyf-syllabus and the minutes are posted on this website. If you'd like to come and talk to us, please do!
